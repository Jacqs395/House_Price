The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that will predict the sale price of a house, using the features provided in the dataset. The goal is to find the most accurate predictive model thru data cleaning, exploration and tuning.

What makes housing prices increase or decrease? 

For this project, I am relying on my experience as a Realtor and Property Manager. In a way, buyers are similar to a machine that is learning how to determine the sale price of a house. Buyers consider the features that they are looking for vs. the features that is in a home. They weigh this against sales data and the asking price of a home, to determine what a house is worth. Similarly, the machine learning model will consider various features to accurately determine how a house's worth.
