# House_Price

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that will predict the sale price of a house, using the features provided in the dataset. My approach to this project is to think like a buyer. In real estate, it's well known that buyers determine the true price of a property. By examining comparable sales in the area that they are considering purchasing in, and also assigning value to amenities and features that they view as important/not important -- buyers have their own set of criteria that they use, to determine how much a home should be worth. 

In this spirit, I will train my machine learning model from the viewpoint of a buyer. 

This dataset consists of 79 variables that describe almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa (according to the Kaggle Overview).
